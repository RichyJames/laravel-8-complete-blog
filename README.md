# laravel fashion blog project

This Laravel blog project focuses on showcasing fashion trends and related content. 

## changes i made to the main page 

a video background has been added into the main page, elevating its visual and creating an engaging atmosphere for visitors. I also change the read more button background colour to fit the background.

i edited the image here to give it rounded edges. By applying this technique, the image blends into the design, providing a modern appearance. and i also changed the background colour to a light blue charcoal colour to give the website a warm feeling.
